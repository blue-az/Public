                <h3>1. The Sinclair Principle</h3>
                <div class="quote">
                    "It is difficult to get a man to understand something, when his salary depends on his not understanding it."
                    <p class="source">- Upton Sinclair, 1934</p>
                </div>
                <p class="description">Explains WHY fallacies persist. Material interest creates motivated reasoning. The "salary" can be literal (funding, job) or social (belonging, status).</p>
            </div>

            <div class="principle-card">
                <h3>2. The Bannon Doctrine</h3>
                <div class="quote">
                    "Flood the zone with shit."
                    <p class="source">- Steve Bannon</p>
                </div>
                <p class="description">Explains the TACTIC. Modern discourse warfare uses multiple stacked fallacies. Refuting one leaves others standing. Quantity > quality. The density IS the defense.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="principle-card">
                <h3>3. The 8 Mile Principle</h3>
                <div class="quote">
                    "Name the pattern before they finish deploying it."
                    <p class="source">- Derived from 8 Mile film</p>
                </div>
                <p class="description">The PRIMARY defense strategy. Once you name a fallacy, it loses power. "That's Poisoned Skittles" stops the pattern mid-deployment. Naming is defusing.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="principle-card">
                <h3>4. The Yoo Doctrine (True Believer Problem)</h3>
                <div class="quote">
                    "Yes, it's banana republic means. That's the point."
                    <p class="source">- John Yoo, paraphrased</p>
                </div>
                <p class="description">What happens when 8 Mile fails. True believers KNOW it's contradictory and ACCEPT that as necessary medicine. The confession IS the inoculation. You can't name what they already embrace.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="principle-card">
                <h3>5. The Federalist Pipeline</h3>
                <div class="quote">
                    "Decades of ideological training creates worldview that processes contradiction as courage."
                    <p class="source">- Observation on Yoo/true believers</p>
                </div>
                <p class="description">Explains HOW true believers are made. Law school → Federalist Society → clerkships → appointments. The pipeline trains people to see ends-justify-means as principled, not hypocritical.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="principle-card">
                <h3>6. Dual Sinclair</h3>
                <div class="quote">
                    "Different arguments for different audiences."
                    <p class="source">- Observed in Douthat case</p>
                </div>
                <p class="description">The 15%/0% split. Acknowledge opponent's arguments to liberal audiences (~15%). Never do this in conservative circles (~0%). Not lying to either - just emphasizing differently. Audience segregation.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="principle-card">
                <h3>7. The Nihilistic Transgressor</h3>
                <div class="quote">
                    "Can you believe that bullshit? Can you believe people believe that bullshit?"
                    <p class="source">- Trump after evangelical prayer, per Michael Cohen</p>
                </div>
                <p class="description">Nihilism enables transgression. Doesn't believe in economy, science, religion - only self. Can say Iraq was lie AND praise dictators because nothing external is REAL. The brand is transgression itself.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="principle-card">
                <h3>8. The Coal Miner's Dilemma</h3>
                <div class="quote">
                    "Jobs aren't only about money. They're about meaning."
                    <p class="source">- Observation on belief as identity infrastructure</p>
                </div>
                <p class="description">Sinclair explains salary-dependence. But some beliefs are PURPOSE. You can't "learn to code" someone's entire life meaning. When belief is identity-load-bearing, logic alone won't work.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="principle-card">
                <h3>9. Protective Fallacy Architecture</h3>
                <div class="quote">
                    "The density is not a bug - it's the defense mechanism."
                    <p class="source">- Observation on self-reinforcing belief systems</p>
                </div>
                <p class="description">Belief systems evolve protective architecture. Multiple stacked claims create structure where questioning any single one seems like "missing the point." Layer 2 protects Layer 1. Find the KEYSTONE - the load-bearing assumption that, if removed, makes others collapse.</p>
                <div style="background: #000; padding: 15px; margin-top: 15px; border: 1px solid #00CCFF;">
                    <p style="color: #FFFF00;"><strong>Example - Salvation Theology:</strong></p>
                    <p style="color: #CCC;">1. Born sinful (creates need)</p>
                    <p style="color: #CCC;">2. Jesus chose death - sacrifice (KEYSTONE)</p>
                    <p style="color: #CCC;">3. Universal scope</p>
                    <p style="color: #CCC;">4. Must believe to access (creates urgency)</p>
                    <p style="color: #00FF00; margin-top: 10px;">Layer 2 protects Layer 1: If you accept "he sacrificed willingly," you can't ask "did he expect divine intervention?"</p>
