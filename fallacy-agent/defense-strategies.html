            <div class="defense-card">
                <h3>1. Pattern Recognition</h3>
                <p class="description">Instead of refuting individual claims, identify the fallacy type and name it. Naming is defusing.</p>
                <div class="example">"That's Poisoned Skittles - using rare bad actors to condemn an entire group."</div>
            </div>

            <div class="defense-card">
                <h3>2. Steelman-Then-Pivot</h3>
                <p class="description">Correctly state opponent's argument first, earn trust, then pivot to prepared counter.</p>
                <div class="example">"What you're going to say is XYZ... [they confirm]... Then consider this thought experiment..."</div>
            </div>

            <div class="defense-card">
                <h3>3. Disengage Signals</h3>
                <p class="description">Recognize when to stop engaging: 5+ fallacies stacked, same claim after refutation, incentive-lock conditions.</p>
                <div class="example">"At this point you're in a content mill, not a debate. Document and move on."</div>
            </div>

            <div class="defense-card">
                <h3>4. Amazon Tribe Thought Experiment</h3>
                <p class="description">Isolate the stated variable in a neutral context to expose whether it's the real objection.</p>
                <div class="example">"If Amazon tribe girls who are 12% stronger can play sports, why not trans girls who are 12% stronger?"</div>
            </div>

            <div class="defense-card">
                <h3>5. Parable as Shield (Defensive)</h3>
                <p class="description">Use a parable to counter a fallacy defensively.</p>
                <div class="example">"Against ad hominem: 'A neighbor-care parable teaches us to judge by actions, not identity.'"</div>
            </div>

            <div class="defense-card">
                <h3>6. Parable as Sword (Aggressive)</h3>
                <p class="description">Challenge opponent to disagree with parable's teaching.</p>
                <div class="example">"Do you reject your own stated moral principle about helping anyone in need?"</div>
            </div>

            <div class="defense-card">
                <h3>7. Parable as Bridge (Consensus)</h3>
                <p class="description">Establish common ground via parable before pivoting.</p>
                <div class="example">"We agree the outsider-helper is the true neighbor, right? So identity doesn't determine truth..."</div>
            </div>

            <div class="defense-card">
                <h3>8. Parable as Foundation (Thought Experiment)</h3>
                <p class="description">Use parable as neutral ground for thought experiments.</p>
                <div class="example">"Like the return-and-restoration parable: if restoration is possible there, why exclude here?"</div>
            </div>

            <div class="defense-card">
                <h3>9. Third Party Focus</h3>
                <p class="description">When facing true believers, stop trying to convince them. Document for the persuadable audience watching.</p>
                <div class="example">"I'm not going to change your mind, but for everyone listening: this is what 'banana republic means' actually looks like..."</div>
            </div>

            <div class="defense-card">
                <h3>10. Principle Archaeology</h3>
                <p class="description">Find their stated principles in OTHER contexts and apply them here. True believers have consistency gaps across domains.</p>
                <div class="example">"You argued in 2015 that executive overreach was unconstitutional. What changed besides the party?"</div>
            </div>

            <div class="defense-card">
                <h3>11. Consequence Focus</h3>
                <p class="description">When logic fails, focus on concrete consequences. True believers may accept contradiction but still fear outcomes.</p>
                <div class="example">"Let's set aside whether it's justified. What happens when the next administration uses this precedent against you?"</div>
            </div>

            <div class="defense-card">
                <h3>12. The Long Game</h3>
                <p class="description">Some battles are generational. Document, educate the next cohort, build counter-infrastructure.</p>
                <div class="example">"This argument will be studied in law schools for decades. We're writing the historical record, not winning today's news cycle."</div>
            </div>

            <h3 class="section-title">~*~ ADVANCED STRATEGIES ~*~</h3>

            <div class="defense-card">
                <h3>13. Mosquito Net Argument</h3>
                <p class="description">Challenge opportunity cost. If someone claims to care about saving lives, compare effectiveness to alternatives.</p>
                <div class="example">"Mosquito nets save ~500-1000 lives per $1M. Abortion restrictions save ??? If you care about saving lives, why this fight?"</div>
                <p style="color: #FFFF00; margin-top: 10px;"><strong>Exposes:</strong> Whether the fight is really about saving lives or about something else (control, identity, religious ethics)</p>
            </div>

            <div class="defense-card">
                <h3>14. Keystone Fallacy Identification</h3>
                <p class="description">In stacked fallacy systems, identify the load-bearing assumption that protects the others. Remove it and the structure wobbles.</p>
                <div class="example">
                    "In salvation theology, the keystone is the willing-sacrifice claim. If expected intervention changes that claim, the transaction model changes."
                </div>
                <p style="color: #00FF00; margin-top: 10px;"><strong>How to identify:</strong> Ask: Which claim, if false, would most change how we interpret the others? That's the keystone.</p>
            </div>
