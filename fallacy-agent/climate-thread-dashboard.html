A lot. the metric they used was only so that they could find some way to state that China is doing something. Stop subsidies on fossil fuels. Apply a tax to address the externality on carbon emissions or fossil fuels. So, yes. Make energy more expensive. Which makes everything that uses energy more expensive. Which is everything. Which hurts economies. No problem though. The rich can pay 50% more or even 200% more for energy. Only the poors get maimed. Control. That is what it is about.

The dark sides of history are more likely to repeat when the island is so much more constrained and resources spent on non-conforming people become so great of a burden. The only way failed systems functioned for any length of time was by purging people who didn&#x27;t align with the system... which by being rigid, has a much larger portion of non-conformists. Refuse to conform by force? Expulsion works for a religious group (like convents, and similar communist success stories) or for fascist groups who just concentrate them for deportation and when that is too slow and/or costly find ways to eliminate people. It is JUVENILE to seriously think moving off world is going to solve problems. Since musk has a teenage maturity...still... he is by definition, a partial moron. He can reason at a higher level; we assume...because he got a degree. Could be, he is a full moron; since a teenager in their 40s certainly would figure out how to put on enough of an act given power and money; teen-level math reasoning plus cheating... You&#x27;d understand if you knew somebody with an 8-year old&#x27;s IQ but was over 40. It&#x27;s not modern science because while their IQ sticks, they still grow with age so characterizing them as 8 years old or 14 years old is unrealistic and far too limited a way to characterize them-- at least to people without psychology education. A permanent 8 year old, stops acting like a child; they always slowly learn - they simply can&#x27;t think at a higher level. So an actual old-school moron could be quite heavily masked at 40 and nearly invisible as a teenager. Tons of below average adults are morons who make up the majority of below average people. They can live just fine other than being manipulated by smarter people to destroy societies. They are the Deltas of our brave new world... ;although, that book from that era, was also stuck thinking that people didn&#x27;t grow. Furthermore, without major mental blocks people&#x27;s IQ is not capped and IQ is more complex. Moron Musk could develop analytical reasoning had a higher level while the rest could be retarded at moron level. Add a PR company (which he&#x27;s had for decades) selling his image... Every teen begins at moron level and then grow; those who can&#x27;t, they are morons - but it doesn&#x27;t mean they can&#x27;t fake progress. Like a sociopath who has no feelings, they learn to fake some normality to succeed socially. A sociopath with a PR firm is probably a good description for many politicians. Just because you are smart enough to not be fooled by Trumpaganda doesn&#x27;t mean you are not being fooled by more subtle examples... the fact somebody needs a PR company to hype/protect them should flag some attention should be paid.</td></tr><tr><td>65985530</td><td>2</td><td></td><td>100</td><td>bad_faith</td><td>bad_faith_performative</td><td>identity_protective_denier</td><td>Manual score 100/100 (bad faith; conf 0.85).

The current trend line&#x27;s deviation from the long term cyclical glacial periods of the Quaternary ice age is 100% driven by human activity. Period. Is it faster than ever, historically speaking? Utterly not. That&#x27;s actually hard to say, but also not relevant. In times when it may have, we simply do not have decade-resolution temperature data. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/... [wikipedia.org] = 90% of the last 500m years has been warmer than today. Absolutely true. Humans evolved, basically in whole, during the Quaternary. It&#x27;s not clear we will even be able to survive when Earth leaves it. This has nothing to do with climate change right now. For the last 5m years we&#x27;ve routinely had warm spikes followed by a decline to Phanerozoic &#x27;norm&#x27; This is the dumbest fucking thing you&#x27;ve said. The Phanerozoic includes the Cretaceous Thermal Maximum, as well as the Quaternary. It is not a period of time for which it makes any sense whatsoever to measure a climate &quot;norm&quot;.

Steady state is absolutely a problem, in the ridiculous timescales he chose. Your xkcd is a much more reasonable timescale to look at, though realistically, I&#x27;d say we should go back about 2 million years to really demonstrate why temperatures 90mya aren&#x27;t relevant to us today. Mankind, biologically would not be able to survive a climate 90mya. We&#x27;re not built for it. It would require technology to survive, and it&#x27;s not clear we&#x27;d still be able to produce it. But none of that matters- that&#x27;s not what current climate change is about. We&#x27;re not talking about knocking us back to the last Thermal Maximum. Humans weren&#x27;t around 90mya. Fucking mammals larger than a squirrel weren&#x27;t around 90mya. Within the next 5-30mya, the Earth is going to transition to an ice-free state again. Only the poles will be habitable to us. That has nothing to do with climate change, which won&#x27;t render our world uninhabitable to us, but will almost certainly cause societal collapse, or at least severe contraction, with migrations and bread basket changes.</td></tr><tr><td>65983348</td><td>2</td><td></td><td>53</td><td>likely_bad_faith</td><td>likely_bad_faith_patterned</td><td>confused_reachable</td><td>Manual score 53/100 (likely bad faith; conf 0.63).

The carbon density of the power in China is coming down at a similar rate to that in the US Yes. But the total amount of carbon China is releasing is going up. A lot. the metric they used was only so that they could find some way to state that China is doing something. Stop subsidies on fossil fuels. Apply a tax to address the externality on carbon emissions or fossil fuels. So, yes. Make energy more expensive. Which makes everything that uses energy more expensive. Which is everything. Which hurts economies. No problem though. The rich can pay 50% more or even 200% more for energy. Only the poors get maimed. Control. That is what it is about.

The dark sides of history are more likely to repeat when the island is so much more constrained and resources spent on non-conforming people become so great of a burden. The only way failed systems functioned for any length of time was by purging people who didn&#x27;t align with the system... which by being rigid, has a much larger portion of non-conformists. Refuse to conform by force? Expulsion works for a religious group (like convents, and similar communist success stories) or for fascist groups who just concentrate them for deportation and when that is too slow and/or costly find ways to eliminate people. It is JUVENILE to seriously think moving off world is going to solve problems. Since musk has a teenage maturity...still... he is by definition, a partial moron. He can reason at a higher level; we assume...because he got a degree. Could be, he is a full moron; since a teenager in their 40s certainly would figure out how to put on enough of an act given power and money; teen-level math reasoning plus cheating... You&#x27;d understand if you knew somebody with an 8-year old&#x27;s IQ but was over 40. It&#x27;s not modern science because while their IQ sticks, they still grow with age so characterizing them as 8 years old or 14 years old is unrealistic and far too limited a way to characterize them-- at least to people without psychology education. A permanent 8 year old, stops acting like a child; they always slowly learn - they simply can&#x27;t think at a higher level. So an actual old-school moron could be quite heavily masked at 40 and nearly invisible as a teenager. Tons of below average adults are morons who make up the majority of below average people. They can live just fine other than being manipulated by smarter people to destroy societies. They are the Deltas of our brave new world... ;although, that book from that era, was also stuck thinking that people didn&#x27;t grow. Furthermore, without major mental blocks people&#x27;s IQ is not capped and IQ is more complex. Moron Musk could develop analytical reasoning had a higher level while the rest could be retarded at moron level. Add a PR company (which he&#x27;s had for decades) selling his image... Every teen begins at moron level and then grow; those who can&#x27;t, they are morons - but it doesn&#x27;t mean they can&#x27;t fake progress. Like a sociopath who has no feelings, they learn to fake some normality to succeed socially. A sociopath with a PR firm is probably a good description for many politicians. Just because you are smart enough to not be fooled by Trumpaganda doesn&#x27;t mean you are not being fooled by more subtle examples... the fact somebody needs a PR company to hype/protect them should flag some attention should be paid.</td></tr><tr><td>65985530</td><td></td><td>2</td><td></td><td>High Risk</td><td>High Risk</td><td></td><td></td><td>100</td><td>bad_faith</td><td>bad_faith_performative</td><td>0.85</td><td>bad_faith</td><td>identity_protective_denier</td><td>6</td><td>0</td><td>yes</td><td>-</td><td>1</td><td>65985530</td><td>Comment shows identity protective denier posture with mixed unclear rubric score (6/8).

You originally said &quot;traditional family unit&quot; not family. You also haven&#x27;t even told me which tradition, i.e. which culture and time period you mean.

Biology, therefore they are both responsible... what. Hate to break it bucko but biology don&#x27;t say shit about responsibility. When (typically the father) abdicates his responsibility, this is not conducive to healthy child development. Yet people do. The question is what are you going to do about it? Ban man of breeding age from the military, for example, so fathers can&#x27;t be deployed? Our society promotes the *fun* or *right* to have sex with whoever you want In this case that would be liberty and the pursuit of happiness. but tends to ignore the responsibility for the products of that sex. It does not. People are at least financially responsible in the eyes of the law. Liberal thinkers want to be free of responsibility, to be able to &quot;love&quot; who they want to, separating the personal &quot;fulfillment&quot; of a sexual relationship, from the responsibility that comes with it. Utter tosh. Liberals on the whole advocate for widely birth control (unlike conservatives) so that when people have those relationships, they can be responsible about it and not have kids. Conservatives aim to take the screwing around that people always do regardless and make it as likely as possible to result in kids out of families, you know by blocking sex education and birth control.</td></tr><tr><td>65985224</td><td>65985080</td><td>2</td><td></td><td>Guarded</td><td>Guarded</td><td></td><td></td><td>43</td><td>mixed_combative</td><td>mixed_combative_low_evidence</td><td>0.57</td><td>unclear</td><td>identity_protective_denier</td><td>6</td><td>2</td><td>no</td><td>False Dichotomy, Straw Man</td><td>2</td><td>65985080,65985022</td><td>Comment shows identity protective denier posture with mixed unclear rubric score (6/8).

Every culture has historically placed responsibility for children on the parents. Many cultures expand that responsibility to others in the community, such as extended family or those in the village, but ultimately, final responsibility belongs to the parents, in nearly every culture in the world. Biology says parents are responsible because of the principle that actions have consequences, and people who act, are responsible for the consequences of those actions. If you rob a bank, you are liable. If you drink and drive, you are liable. If you work hard and earn a good living, you get to keep (most of) the fruit of your labor. If you have sex and produce a baby, you are responsible for that baby. It&#x27;s not merely a morality question, it&#x27;s about actions and consequences.

The collapse of the boreal forests and the collapse of the Amazon forest, for instance, might be avoidable. Every single move toward higher energy costs and lower emissions has come from the west. Lower emissions are associated with lower energy costs in the USA, [blogspot.com] which is part of the west. India, China and most of Africa are pouring pollution into the planet at rates rising faster than the west could ever hope to offset even if we were willing to destroy the economies of the west. The carbon density of the power in China is coming down at a similar rate to that in the US [ourworldindata.org]. India is slower. Africa doesn&#x27;t have a lot of data, and outside Egypt and South Africa is dominated by how people overcome the logistics of poor supply. But is it a waste of time giving you these links? Is there some technological reason why you can&#x27;t follow them? So, tell me. What should the West do to stop this calamity? Making cheaper electricity doesn&#x27;t destroy your economy. Stop subsidies on fossil fuels. Apply a tax to address the externality on carbon emissions or fossil fuels. Seriously.

So how does one define a family? Biology answers this unequivocally. It takes a father and a mother to produce a child. The two of them are inherently responsible for raising that child. When (typically the father) abdicates his responsibility, this is not conducive to healthy child development. Our society promotes the *fun* or *right* to have sex with whoever you want, but tends to ignore the responsibility for the products of that sex. Those who deny this, are simply wrong on that point. Are there exceptions? Are there women who should be free of an abusive or deadbeat man? Yes, absolutely. That is not what the argument is about. Liberal thinkers want to be free of responsibility, to be able to &quot;love&quot; who they want to, separating the personal &quot;fulfillment&quot; of a sexual relationship, from the responsibility that comes with it. That is a completely different thing from abusive relationships. You can&#x27;t negate a principle by citing exceptions. The right plays the same games when it comes to global warming. They want the &quot;fun&quot; (or whatever goal) of doing things that pollute, without recognizing their responsibility to manage well the environment they live in.</td></tr><tr><td>65985246</td><td>65985036</td><td>2</td><td></td><td>Monitor</td><td>Monitor</td><td></td><td></td><td>23</td><td>mixed_constructive</td><td>mixed_constructive_factual_no_citation</td><td>0.57</td><td>unclear</td><td>confused_reachable</td><td>6</td><td>0</td><td>no</td><td>-</td><td>3</td><td>65985036,65983576,65983102</td><td>Comment shows confused reachable posture with mixed unclear rubric score (6/8).

But biology gives the initial responsibility of care for a child to the two parents, who will, without exception, be a man and a woman. Once transferred, the responsibility belongs to the adoptive parents, whoever that may be. So how do we fix it? Well for starters, through a favorite technique espoused by liberals: education. Stop focusing sex education on the mechanics of sex, and focus more on the responsibilities of child rearing. Stop glorifying promiscuity in schools and in the movies. Educate children more about responsibility in general, rather than on pleasure. Children will figure out how to have pleasure all on their own, we don&#x27;t need to teach them that.

Since most people associate &quot;runaway&quot; with &quot;literally no way to stop until there&#x27;s no water left on the planet&quot;, a la Venus, it&#x27;s definitely not a term that should be used by Scientists. Which is why it isn&#x27;t.

I sounded an alarm on Methane and its clathrates some years before it became mainstreamed. Many still ignore the clathrates. Instead of Temperature rise, let&#x27;s look at this issue as energy retention or rejection. What we do know is that there is a direct correlation between the composition of an atmosphere and its energy retention properties. Some things like water vapor, Carbon Dioxide and methane are hard to reject as energy retention vectors. And there are energy rejection vectors as well. Sulfuric or Hydrogen Chloride aerosols do that trick. Some have even proposed injecting those aerosols into the atmosphere purposely. Utterly foolish. Trade off AGW for thousands of years of acid rain. Which might just make for more extinctions than AGW. Remember - the aerosols wash out of the atmosphere quickly, using the water cycle, measured in days. As soon as you stop the injection, the energy retention increases again.</td></tr><tr><td>65986644</td><td>65986278</td><td>2</td><td></td><td>Constructive</td><td>Constructive</td><td></td><td></td><td>10</td><td>mixed_constructive</td><td>mixed_constructive_normative_no_citation</td><td>0.55</td><td>good_faith</td><td>empirical_skeptic</td><td>7</td><td>0</td><td>no</td><td>-</td><td>2</td><td>65986278,65985782</td><td>Comment shows empirical skeptic posture with good faith actor rubric score (7/8).

That $20k is enough to buy land, sometimes considerable land, all over the country. You don&#x27;t have to build your dream home right away, so consider that you can have a livable structure up for often less than $100k. A slab foundation and a pole building, for example, will give you a lot more space than your closet apartment, privacy, and let you save to buy the home you really want. Imagine saving $20k every year instead of burning it on rent. That&#x27;s $100k in 5 years. $200k in 10 years. That&#x27;s just savings, it can be considerably more if you make sensible investments.

So, are you saying that you think that there is no longer any action we can take that would avoid a complete disaster? Every kilogram of CO2 makes it worse. But the opportunity to keep the earth below 1.5 degrees of warming, passed about the time Gore was speaking of. 8 degrees of warming is worse than 7.5 degrees of warming. Ice sheets are growing. It blows me away that you can post in a thread with multiple links to how much the ice sheets are shedding mass, and claim that the Ice sheets are growing.

As for Nor, you named him but typed nothing. Nor Pachuri, as in neither Pachuri. As in &quot;you haven&#x27;t provided evidence that he was wrong either&quot;. Because probably he was the head of the UN climate panel, supposedly an EXPERT, and he stated that the point of no return was 4 years earlier than Gore. That&#x27;s not from his work. His background is engineering and economics. The IPCC is half a dozen people. The EXPERTS are the thousands of scientists who volunteer their time to the working groups. But he&#x27;s wasn&#x27;t wrong either. X year passes, same statements made, only change is now it is Y year! Can you please link me to a couple or few instances of where the same statements have been published by a scientific body, but the year backdated? Because a lot of the other stuff you&#x27;ve said here has been opposite to the facts, so I worry that you&#x27;re mistaken about this too. Look at what they implement if you want to know why they yell. Massive, dirty lithium mines, and other heavy metal mining operations stripping the earth for electric car batteries. Oh, good to see you&#x27;re concerned about the environment. Is it only the impact of lithium mines that concerns you, and those heavy metals that are used for batteries? Because Humanity uses many resources for many things. A single 3 Megawatt (MW) wind turbine requires 335 tons of steel, 4.7 tons of copper, 3 tons of aluminum, 2 tons of rare earths and 1,200 tons of concrete. Infrastructure takes resources. Roads. Coal Plants. Bridges. Wind Turbines. Wind turbines produce the cheapest electricity there is with no fuel costs, no fuel logistics, and without greenhouse emissions during operation. You&#x27;re welcome to be a luddite, but if you&#x27;re concerned about concrete, shouldn&#x27;t you start complaining about roads? They cost more in energy, created mostly by fossil fuels to create than they will ever offset. Nope. The embodied energy in a wind turbine, that is, the energy used in its manufacture, transport, erection and operation is generally paid back within 6-12 months of operation. [todayshomeowner.com] Those massive composite blades last 20 -25 years and to this date they have no idea how to recycle any of the blade. Carbon fibre and fibreglass aren&#x27;t easy to recycle, but: 1) Not impossible: Carbon Rivers Makes Wind Turbine Blade Recycling and Upcycling a Reality With Support From DOE [energy.gov] 2) Represent nearly no part of the mass of the turbine 90% or so of which can be recycled We are regulating heavily, subsidizing and diverting energy to, &quot;Green Technologies&quot; that kill the environment.

That was one prediction by Dr Wieslaw Maslowski of the Naval Postgraduate School in California. And not for either ice cap. Nor for 2012. It was for the northern summer sea ice, and was based on the 28% drop in minimum extent between summer 2006 and summer 2007 being a tipping point rather than, as it turned out, a bad year. And the prediction was &quot;inside five to seven years&quot; which was about 2013-2014 not 2012. And while the denialiosphere will use one paper and claim that it discredits the entire fields of thermodynamics, optics and earth science, it doesn&#x27;t. But even then they don&#x27;t usually claim that it was a prediction of total ice loss of Greenland (Which would raise sea levels about 7 metres), much less Antarctica (Which would raise sea levels a further 58 metres). Congratulations. You&#x27;ve managed to hit a whole new level of wrong. When are people going to stop falling for this Oh, the irony. They have been CATASTROPHICALLY wrong every single time.

The one from the early 80s was a bit conservative, but they&#x27;ve all been pretty close since then. Perhaps you can link to a few of these papers you think got it wrong? In 2006, former vice-president Al Gore projected that unless drastic measures were implemented, the planet would hit an irreversible “point of no return” by 2016. Game over. We&#x27;ve past 350 ppm of CO2, which is the level that will come with the high-cost high casualty impacts of greater than 1.5C of warming. Currently we&#x27;re at 427 ppm. So Gore hasn&#x27;t been shown to be wrong. Perhaps the problems is that you don&#x27;t understand that it takes decades for half the warming from an increase in CO2 to have occurred.

They cost more in energy, created mostly by fossil fuels to create than they will ever offset. Those massive composite blades last 20 -25 years and to this date they have no idea how to recycle any of the blade. They, &quot;Hope&quot; to in the future. We are regulating heavily, subsidizing and diverting energy to, &quot;Green Technologies&quot; that kill the environment. While hamstringing and blocking clean, proven, cheap nuclear power.

When you finally settled on an answer I was able to point why it was wrong, something it appears you decided to ignore. The underlying principle is that people are responsible for their own actions. This principle is not seriously debated. All civilized, non-corrupt legal systems are built on this principle. Your opinion is not a fact no matter how strongly you state it. The &quot;personal responsibility&quot; mantra is most common in the Anglosphere and in particular America. Outside of there there&#x27;s a more reasoned approach whereby people recognise that both personal responsibility and systemic factors have an effect. The refusal to have anything other than a blinkered view of such things is why Americas teen pregnancy rate and road death rate is so high compared to all of its peers. So again, are you blaming kids for not being responsible when you refuse to teach them how to be? You are incorrect about hunter-gatherers. These tribes divided responsibilities for the children: the mothers took care of the most of the daily care, cleaning, and teaching, because the fathers were away hunting. The fathers were responsible for feeding their children and providing shelter. No you are incorrect. https://www.acamh.org/blog/hun... [acamh.org] In many hunter-gatherer societies, alloparents provide almost half of a childâ(TM)s care.

There are a lot of people on slashdot who seem to have a lot of psychoses invested in global warming being irrefutable.</td></tr><tr><td>65983554</td><td>65983464</td><td></td><td></td><td>Constructive</td><td>Constructive</td><td></td><td></td><td>0</td><td>good_faith</td><td>good_faith_evidence_attached</td><td>0.65</td><td>good_faith</td><td>empirical_skeptic</td><td>7</td><td>1</td><td>no</td><td>appeal to fear</td><td>3</td><td>65983464,65983314,65983102</td><td>Comment shows empirical skeptic posture with good faith actor rubric score (7/8).

[dailymail.co.uk] &quot; Scientists are baffled to discover 3,100 glaciers SURGING – as they warn it could be even more &#x27;troublesome&#x27; than glacial retreat While many of the world&#x27;s glaciers are in rapid retreat, scientists have been baffled to find 3,100 that are &#x27;surging&#x27;. While this might sound like a good thing, the experts warn that it could be even more &#x27;troublesome&#x27; than glacial retreat. During a surge, a glacier sends large amounts of ice built up over decades racing downhill, where it rapidly melts in the warm lower-altitude weather.&quot;</td></tr>
